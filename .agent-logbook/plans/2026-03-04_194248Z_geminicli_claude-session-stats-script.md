# Claude Session Stats Script

## Goal

Create a script to aggregate token usage and models used for a specific Claude session ID by searching through `~/.claude/projects`.

## Scope

- Create a Node.js script (using `fs`, `path`, and potentially `readline` for large JSONL files).
- Script should accept a session ID as an argument.
- Script should search all subdirectories in `~/.claude/projects` for `.jsonl` files.
- Script should also search for a directory named after the session ID in each project folder, and if it contains a `subagents` subdirectory, aggregate stats from all `.jsonl` files within it.
- For a matching session ID and its subagents, it should aggregate:
    - Total input tokens
    - Total output tokens
    - Total cache creation input tokens
    - Total cache read input tokens
    - List of models used (unique)
- Output the stats in a clean format, showing breakdown between main session and subagents.
## Steps

1.  **Research Data Structure:**
    - I've already confirmed `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/<project-dir>/<session-id>.jsonl` exist.
    - Also need to check if multiple `.jsonl` files can have the same session ID or if the filename is always the session ID.
    - Based on my `ls`, the filename is indeed the session ID.
2.  **Implementation:**
    - Location: `.rulesync/skills/agent-logbook/scripts/claude-session-stats.js`
    - Use `fs.promises` for file operations.
    - Use `readline` for memory-efficient JSONL parsing.
    - Add a helper to find the file(s) across project directories.
3.  **Validation:**
    - Run the script with a known session ID from `letuscook` project.
    - Verify results match manual inspection of the JSONL file.
4.  **Finalize:**
    - Make the script executable.
    - Document usage in `SKILL.md` or a separate README.

## Open Questions

- Does `sessionId` always match the filename? (Seems so, but checking `sessionId` field inside JSON is safer).
- Are there other directories where session data might be stored? (User also mentioned `~/.claude/projects`).
- Should it handle cases where a session is spread across multiple projects (unlikely but possible)?
