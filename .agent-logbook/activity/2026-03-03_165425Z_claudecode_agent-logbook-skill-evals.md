# Agent Logbook Skill — Eval Run (Iteration 1)

## Summary

Ran the first full evaluation of the `agent-logbook` skill using the skill-creator workflow. The skill scored 100% across all 3 evals; the no-skill baseline scored ~52%. Results reviewed and approved by the user.

## Context

The `agent-logbook` skill was previously created (and renamed from `agent-docs`). A prior attempt to run evals using Gemini CLI failed due to API access issues. This session picked up from the existing `evals.json` (3 test cases already written) and completed the full skill-creator eval loop.

## Work Performed

1. **Spawned 6 eval runs in parallel** — 3 with-skill, 3 without-skill:
   - Eval 0: Activity log for a TanStack Router auth refactor
   - Eval 1: ADR for switching from Lucia to Clerk
   - Eval 2: Research report for Drizzle ORM vs Prisma

2. **Drafted and saved assertions** to `evals/evals.json` and `eval_metadata.json` files while runs were in flight:
   - Structural checks: correct subdirectory, UTC timestamp in filename, YAML frontmatter with `type:` field
   - Content checks: key facts from the prompt appear in the document body

3. **Graded all 6 runs** via parallel grader subagents. Results:
   | Eval | With Skill | Without Skill |
   |------|-----------|---------------|
   | 0 — activity log | 7/7 (100%) | 2/7 (29%) |
   | 1 — ADR | 8/8 (100%) | 5/8 (63%) |
   | 2 — research | 8/8 (100%) | 5/8 (63%) |

4. **Reorganized workspace** into `eval-N/config/run-1/` structure to match aggregate_benchmark script expectations.

5. **Ran `aggregate_benchmark.py`** — produced `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md`.

6. **Launched eval viewer** on port 3117 — user reviewed all outputs and left "looks great" feedback.

7. **Cleaned up** the 4 test files inadvertently written to `.agent-docs/` by eval subagents during execution.

## Outcome

The skill is working correctly. The +48 point pass rate improvement (100% vs 52%) validates that the skill's value lies in enforcing structural conventions — without it, agents produce good content but consistently miss directory placement, timestamped filenames, and YAML frontmatter.

### Follow-up tasks

- [ ] Run description optimization (`run_loop.py`) to tune the skill's trigger description
- [ ] Consider updating eval runner prompts to write outputs to workspace only (avoid `.agent-docs/` pollution on future runs)
- [ ] Package the skill as a `.skill` file when ready to distribute
