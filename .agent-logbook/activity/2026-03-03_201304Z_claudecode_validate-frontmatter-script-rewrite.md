# Agent Logbook Skill Improvements

## Summary

Improved the `agent-logbook` skill across two sessions: added conventions
(References section in templates, skill-creator workspace rule), removed the
redundant `README.md`, and built a frontmatter validator — first as a TypeScript
script, then replaced with a simpler bash script + `schema.json` using `yq` and
`pnpx ajv-cli`.

## Context

Follow-up work after the initial skill eval run (see
`2026-03-03_165425Z_claudecode_agent-logbook-skill-evals.md`). The goal was to
make the skill more robust with tooling and cleaner conventions.

## Work Performed

1. **Added `## References` section** to all four templates (activity, research,
   decision, plan) and added a note at the top of the Templates section explaining
   when to include it.

2. **Deleted `.agent-logbook/README.md`** — content was superseded by `SKILL.md`.
   One gap noted but accepted: README had per-folder naming variants (research and
   decisions omitted agent name; plans used `feature_plan_v1.md` format). The
   skill's unified format was kept as the new standard.

3. **Created `.rulesync/rules/skill-creator.md`** — documents that skill-creator
   eval workspaces must go in `.skill-creator/` at the project root, not inside
   `.rulesync/skills/` (which rulesync scans and requires a `SKILL.md` in every
   subdirectory). Also fixed the pre-existing rulesync breakage caused by
   `agent-logbook-workspace` living in `.rulesync/skills/`.

4. **Added a TypeScript `validate-frontmatter.ts` script** (first iteration) using
   `gray-matter@^4` for frontmatter parsing and `typebox@^0.34` + `TypeCompiler`
   for schema validation. Supported `--json` output and `--help`; exit codes 0/1/2.

5. **Replaced the TypeScript script** with a simpler bash script
   (`validate-frontmatter.sh`) + `schema.json`, using `yq` for frontmatter
   extraction and `pnpx ajv-cli` for JSON Schema validation. The TS approach was
   over-engineered (inline bun specifiers, fake npm package wrapper, workspace
   entanglement).
   - Tried `pnpx jsonschema` — package has no binary, abandoned.
   - Tried piping yq output directly to `pnpx <validator>` — pnpm dlx runs in a
     temp working directory, so piped stdin and `/dev/stdin` both fail.
   - Settled on `ajv-cli` with a temp dir: loop through `.md` files, extract
     frontmatter as JSON via `yq -o=json --front-matter=extract`, run one
     `pnpx ajv-cli validate` call for all files, `trap` for cleanup.

6. **Created `schema.json`** — JSON Schema draft-07 covering all required and
   optional frontmatter fields.

7. **Updated `SKILL.md`** throughout to reflect final state.

8. **Ran `rulesync generate`** to sync all changes to `.claude/`, `.cursor/`,
   `.gemini/`.

## Outcome

Script is ~35 lines of bash with no build step, no Node dependencies to manage,
and no workspace interaction. `pnpx ajv-cli` is fetched on demand by pnpm dlx.
Verified against all 7 existing logbook entries — all pass, exit 0.

### Key constraint discovered

`pnpx` (pnpm dlx) runs in an isolated temp directory. Piped stdin and process
substitution (`/dev/fd/N`) are not accessible to the subprocess, so a real temp
file is required to pass data to any `pnpx`-invoked tool.

### Follow-up tasks

- [ ] Run `bash .claude/skills/agent-logbook/scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh`
      after future logbook writes to catch issues early
- [ ] Consider wiring the validator into `pnpm lint` or a pre-commit hook
