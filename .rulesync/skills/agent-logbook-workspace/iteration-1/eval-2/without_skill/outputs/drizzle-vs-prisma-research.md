# ORM Research: Drizzle vs Prisma

**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Status:** Decision Made

## Summary

After research comparing Drizzle ORM and Prisma, the decision is to proceed with **Drizzle ORM**.

## Comparison

### Drizzle ORM

**Strengths:**
- Faster performance — Drizzle generates leaner SQL with less overhead compared to Prisma's query engine abstraction layer.
- Better TypeScript support — Drizzle is built SQL-first and exposes a fully type-safe query builder that maps closely to SQL semantics, resulting in more accurate type inference.
- Lightweight — no separate binary/query engine process; runs entirely in the Node.js/runtime process.
- Schema defined in TypeScript — no separate schema language (SDL) to learn.

**Weaknesses:**
- Smaller ecosystem and community compared to Prisma.
- CLI tooling is less polished.

### Prisma

**Strengths:**
- Nicer CLI — `prisma migrate`, `prisma studio`, and related tools provide a smooth developer experience for migrations and data browsing.
- Larger community and more mature ecosystem.
- Prisma Studio provides a GUI for inspecting and editing data.

**Weaknesses:**
- Slower query performance due to the query engine layer.
- TypeScript support is less precise; types are generated from the schema SDL rather than inferred directly from query expressions.
- Requires a separate query engine binary at runtime.

## Decision

**Use Drizzle ORM.**

The performance advantage and superior TypeScript type inference outweigh Prisma's nicer CLI tooling. The CLI difference is manageable, and Drizzle's schema-as-code approach aligns well with a TypeScript-first codebase.
